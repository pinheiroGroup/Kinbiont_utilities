These scripts report some of the Kinbiont tests on simulated data.

- 'NL_vs_ODE.jl' compares the ODE and NL fitting.
- 'change_point_detection_test' generates a piecewise model and evaluates the goodness of the change point detection algorithms.
'max_gr_comparison.jl' compares the model-based and log-linear approaches to evaluating the maximum exponential growth rate.
- 'NL_sensitivity_synt_benchmark.jl' and 'ODE_sensitivity_synt_benchmark.jl' test the sensitivity analysis on simulated data.
