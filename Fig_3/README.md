In this folder are present data and script to replicate the automatic detection of the Monod laws and analyze the pre-processing  effects on parameters inference

1. 'comparison_preprocessing_EXP1.jl' in this script we perfom  ODE fittings of experiment 1. Here we compare the presence and absence of Multiple scattering correction and blank subtraction.
   
2. 'fit_seg_experiment_1_plus_ml.jl' in this script we fit a file with a segmented ODE and then we perform the symbolic regression on both strain and growth rate and total growth.
